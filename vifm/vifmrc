" vim: filetype=vim :
" Sample configuration file for vifm (last updated: 28 June, 2016)
" You can edit this file by hand.
" The " character at the beginning of a line comments out the line.
" Blank lines are ignored.
" The basic format for each item is shown with an example.

" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

" This is the actual command used to start vi.  The default is vim.
" If you would like to use another vi clone such as Elvis or Vile
" you will need to change this setting.

set vicmd=vim
" set vicmd=elvis\ -G\ termcap
" set vicmd=vile

" Trash Directory
" The default is to move files that are deleted with dd or :d to
" the trash directory.  If you change this you will not be able to move
" files by deleting them and then using p to put the file in the new location.
" I recommend not changing this until you are familiar with vifm.
" This probably shouldn't be an option.

set trash

" This is how many directories to store in the directory history.

set history=100

" Automatically resolve symbolic links on l or Enter.

set nofollowlinks

" With this option turned on you can run partially entered commands with
" unambiguous beginning using :! (e.g. :!Te instead of :!Terminal or :!Te<tab>).

set fastrun

" Natural sort of (version) numbers within text.

set sortnumbers

" Maximum number of changes that can be undone.

set undolevels=100

" If you installed the vim.txt help file set vimhelp.
" If would rather use a plain text help file set novimhelp.

set novimhelp

" If you would like to run an executable file when you
" press return on the file name set this.

set runexec

" Use KiB, MiB, ... instead of KB, MB, ...

set noiec

" Selected color scheme

colorscheme solarized-dark

" Format for displaying time in file list. For example:
" TIME_STAMP_FORMAT=%m/%d-%H:%M
" See man date or man strftime for details.

set timefmt=%m/%d\ %H:%M

" Show list of matches on tab completion in command-line mode

set wildmenu

" Display completions in a form of popup with descriptions of the matches

set wildstyle=popup

" Display suggestions in normal, visual and view modes for keys, marks and
" registers (at most 5 files).  In other view, when available.

set suggestoptions=normal,visual,view,otherpane,keys,marks,registers

" Ignore case in search patterns unless it contains at least one uppercase
" letter

set ignorecase
set smartcase

" Don't highlight search results automatically

set nohlsearch

" Use increment searching (search while typing)
set incsearch

" Try to leave some space from cursor to upper/lower border in lists

set scrolloff=4

" Don't do too many requests to slow file systems

" :com[mand][!] command_name action
" The following macros can be used in a command
" %a is replaced with the user arguments.
" %c the current file under the cursor.
" %C the current file under the cursor in the other directory.
" %f the current selected file, or files.
" %F the current selected file, or files in the other directory.
" %b same as %f %F.

" The file type is for the default programs to be used with
" a file extension.
" :filetype pattern1,pattern2 defaultprogram,program2
" :fileviewer pattern1,pattern2 consoleviewer
" The other programs for the file type can be accessed with the :file command
" The command macros %f, %F, %d, %F may be used in the commands.
" The %a macro is ignored.  To use a % you must put %%.

" For automated FUSE mounts, you must register an extension with :file[x]type
" in one of following formats:
"
" Syntax highlighting in preview
"
" Explicitly set highlight type for some extensions
"
" 256-color terminal
" fileviewer *.[ch],*.[ch]pp highlight -O xterm256 -s dante --syntax c %c
" fileviewer Makefile,Makefile.* highlight -O xterm256 -s dante --syntax make %c
"
" 16-color terminal
" fileviewer *.c,*.h highlight -O ansi -s dante %c
"
" Or leave it for automatic detection
"
" fileviewer *[^/] pygmentize -O style=monokai -f console256 -g

" Displaying pictures in terminal
"
" fileviewer *.jpg,*.png shellpic %c

" Open all other files with default system programs (you can also remove all
" :file[x]type commands above to ensure they don't interfere with system-wide
" settings).  By default all unknown files are opened with 'vi[x]cmd'
" uncommenting one of lines below will result in ignoring 'vi[x]cmd' option
" for unknown file types.
" For *nix:
filetype * gio open
" For OS X:
" filetype * open
" For Windows:
" filetype * start, explorer

" What should be saved automatically between vifm runs
" Like in previous versions of vifm
" set vifminfo=options,filetypes,commands,bookmarks,dhistory,state,cs
" Like in vi
set vifminfo=dhistory,savedirs,chistory,state,tui,shistory,
    \phistory,fhistory,dirstack,registers,bookmarks,bmarks

" Examples of configuring both panels

" Customize view columns a bit (enable ellipsis for truncated file names)
"
" windo set viewcolumns=-{name}..,6{}.
